The provided Python code implements a basic Caesar cipher encryption and decryption program. The alphabet is represented by a list of lowercase letters. The `encryption` function takes a `plain_text` message and a `shift_key` as inputs. It iterates through each character in the input text, shifts its position in the alphabet by the specified key, and appends the encrypted character to the `cipher_text`. The `decryption` function reverses the process by shifting the characters in the opposite direction. The program runs in a loop, allowing users to choose between encryption and decryption, input a message, set a shift key, and view the result. Users can continue or exit the program based on their preference. The implementation provides a hands-on understanding of the classic Caesar cipher algorithm,making it accessible for users to experiment with encryption and decryption processes.
